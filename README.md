# Dronology

## Getting Started

The following directions explain how to setup your computer as a development machine. By the end you should be able to build, test, run, and modify the project.

1. Install a [JDK 8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org). Make sure the JDK's bin directory is in your `PATH`. On some platforms, like Windows, you also need to make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set up and pointing to the directory where the JDK is installed. On Windows, you also need to add the JDK's bin directory to your `PATH` variable. Make sure that Maven's bin directory is in your `PATH` too. On Ubuntu you can quickly install a JDK and Maven with:
	```bash
	sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk maven
	```
	On Ubuntu, using the above command, you don't need to setup environment variables.

1. Clone the project:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:SAREC-Lab/Dronology.git
   ```

1. Build, test, package, and install the project in your local Maven repository:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/Dronology
    mvn install
    ````
	
1. In a terminal, run the Vaadin UI:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/Dronology/edu.nd.dronology.ui.vaadin
    mvn jetty:run
    ```
    This starts a web server that you will connect to in a later step. This runs until you stop it with Ctrl + C.

1. In a terminal, run Dronology:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/Dronology/edu.nd.dronology.services.launch
    mvn exec:java
    ```
    This runs until you stop it with Ctrl + C.

1. Open your browser and navigate to the Dronology web UI at [http://localhost:8080/vaadinui](http://localhost:8080/vaadinui).

### Tips and Troubleshooting
* If you plan to work with the source code, consider installing an IDE. Popular IDEs like [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org), [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/downloads/) and [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) all work well with maven projects like this one.

* Sometimes it's necessary to run the project even if tests are failing. To force the Maven install command use:
    ```bash
    mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
    ```

* If your local maven repository gets messed up, you can force maven to re-download dependencies, rebuild everything and install:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/Dronology
    mvn clean
    cd ~/.m2/repository
    rm -rf *
    cd /path/to/Dronology
    mvn install
    ```
