To run the current version of Dronology. 
Go to edu.nd.dronology.services.launcher and invoke DronologyServiceRunner.java
This will start up the services (note that you'll currently see errors as it starts up the Ground Station middleware.
(you can ignore this for now).

There are several options for running a placeholder GUI.  The easiest one (with the least functionality too) can be invoked from:
edu.nd.dronology.ui.javafx.start DronologyFXUIRunner.java
